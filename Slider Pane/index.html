                <h4>Socrates</h4>
                <p>
                    Socrates was a classical Greek (Athenian) philosopher credited as one of the founders of Western philosophy.
                    He is an enigmatic figure known chiefly through the accounts of classical writers, especially the writings of his students Plato
                    and Xenophon and the plays of his contemporary Aristophanes.
                    Plato's dialogues are among the most comprehensive accounts of Socrates to survive from antiquity, though it is unclear the degree
                    to which Socrates himself is "hidden behind his 'best disciple', Plato".

                <h4>Aristotle</h4>
                <p>
                    Aristotle was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece.
                    His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian.At seventeen or eighteen years of
                    age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover
                    many subjects – including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric,
                    linguistics, politics and government – and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died,
                    Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC.

                <h4>Plato</h4>
                <p>
                    Plato was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world.
                    He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition.
                    Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire œuvre is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years.

                <p>
                    Pythagoras of Samos was an Ionian Greek philosopher, mathematician, and the putative founder of the movement called Pythagoreanism.
                    Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos,
                    and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India.Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos.

                    Heraclitus of Ephesus was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher, and a native of the city of Ephesus,
                    then part of the Persian Empire. He was of distinguished parentage. Little is known about his early life and education,
                    but he regarded himself as self-taught and a pioneer of wisdom. From the lonely life he led, and still more from the apparently riddled and allegedly paradoxical
                    nature of his philosophy and his stress upon the needless unconsciousness of humankind,he was called "The Obscure" and the "Weeping Philosopher".

                    Thales of Miletus was a pre-Socratic Greek/Phonecian philosopher, mathematician and astronomer from Miletus in Asia Minor, current day Milet
                    in Turkey and one of the Seven Sages of Greece. Many, most notably Aristotle, regard him as the first philosopher in the Greek tradition, and he is otherwise historically
                    recognised as the first individual in Western civilisation known to have entertained and engaged in scientific philosophy.

                    Anaximenes of Miletus was an Ancient Greek Pre-Socratic philosopher active in the latter half of the 6th century BC.
                    One of the three Milesian philosophers, he is identified as a younger friend or student of Anaximander.Anaximenes, like others in his school of thought, practiced material monism.
                    This tendency to identify one specific underlying reality made up of a material thing is what Anaximenes is principally known for today

                    Anaximander was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher who lived in Miletus,a city of Ionia (in modern-day Turkey).
                    He belonged to the Milesian school and learned the teachings of his master Thales. He succeeded Thales and became
                    the second master of that school where he counted Anaximenes and, arguably, Pythagoras amongst his pupils.

                <p>
                    Rene Descartes was a French philosopher, mathematician, and scientist. Dubbed the father of modern western philosophy,
                    much of subsequent Western philosophy is a response to his writings,which are studied closely to this day. He spent about 20 years of his life in the Dutch Republic.

                <p>
                    Niccolo Machiavelli, or more formally Niccolo di Bernardo dei Machiavelli, was an Italian Renaissance historian,
                    politician, diplomat, philosopher, humanist, and writer. He has often been called the founder of modern political science.
                    He was for many years a senior official in the Florentine Republic, with responsibilities in diplomatic and military affairs. He also wrote comedies, carnival songs, and poetry.
                    His personal correspondence is renowned in the Italian language. He was secretary to the Second Chancery of the Republic of Florence from 1498 to 1512, when the Medici were out of power.
                    He wrote his most renowned work The Prince in 1513.
